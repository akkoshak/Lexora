# Lexora — AI Glossary & Learning App

> A submission for the [AI Glossary Challenge (AIGC)](https://aigc.icaire.org/en) — an ICAIRE-led international initiative focused on ethical AI, cultural grounding, and AI governance in Saudi Arabia.

---

## Overview

Lexora is a SwiftUI-based iOS app built around a curated dataset of over 1,200 AI terms in English and Arabic. Developed as part of the **AI Glossary Challenge (تحدي معجم الذكاء الاصطناعي)**, the app aims to make AI terminology accessible, culturally grounded, and engaging for Arabic-speaking audiences.

The app combines a comprehensive bilingual dictionary with interactive learning tools and real-time word detection features — bridging the gap between AI literacy and cultural relevance.

## AI Glossary Challenge

The **AI Glossary Challenge** is an initiative by [ICAIRE](https://aigc.icaire.org/en) that promotes awareness of AI concepts through culturally grounded, bilingual terminology. Lexora directly supports this mission by:

- Providing a searchable, bilingual (English + Arabic) glossary of 1,200+ AI terms
- Making AI vocabulary accessible through interactive and gamified learning experiences
- Enabling real-time word detection via camera, voice, and video — lowering the barrier to discovering AI terminology in everyday contexts

## Features

### 📖 Dictionary
- Browse and search 1,200+ AI terms in English and Arabic
- Paginated list with infinite scroll — loads 10 entries at a time
- Expandable cards showing the English definition, Arabic translation, and part of speech
- Part of speech is automatically detected using Apple's **Natural Language** framework, supporting multi-word terms
- Bookmark any word with the ★ button to save it for later review

### 🏠 Home
- **Word of the Day** — a deterministic daily term selected from the glossary based on the current date, the same word all day and a new one every day
- **Daily Streak** — tracks consecutive days of app usage using `UserDefaults`, with an animated weekly progress view

### 🎓 Learning Hub
- **Flashcards** — a 10-card session where each card shows a word's definition and four multiple-choice answer options. Tracks correct and incorrect answers, auto-advances after each response, and shows a results summary at the end
- **Word Search** — generates a 10×10 letter grid with 6 randomly selected glossary words placed in all 8 directions. Features pixel-based diagonal drag detection using `atan2` angle snapping for accurate selection

### ➕ Capture (Plus Button)
Three real-time word detection tools accessible from the center tab bar button:

- **📷 Camera Scanner** — live camera feed using `AVCaptureSession` and Apple's **Vision** framework for real-time OCR. Detected text is matched against the glossary and displayed in an overlay card when a term is found
- **🎤 Voice Detector** — uses `SFSpeechRecognizer` and `AVAudioEngine` to transcribe spoken words live, then looks them up in the glossary and navigates to the full definition
- **🎬 Video Extractor** — upload a video from the photo library. Speech is transcribed using timestamp-accurate `SFTranscriptionSegment` data. Words appear in a live sliding window of 10 at a time in sync with the video, with glossary matches highlighted as tappable blue pills

### 👤 Profile
- Displays all bookmarked words using the same expandable card style as the Dictionary
- Persisted across app sessions using `UserDefaults`
- Shows an empty state with guidance when no words have been saved yet
